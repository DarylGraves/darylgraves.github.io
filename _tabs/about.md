## Quick Summary
Thirty-something IT Professional with a variety of experience across various Microsoft technologies. I am passionate about continuous-learning, new technologies and sharing knowledge with others. 

I enjoy automating solutions and use PowerShell as my weapon of choice. Recently I have transitioned from a SysAdmin role to become a Cloud Engineer where I spend most of my time designing, implementing and maintaining a wide range of environments in Microsoft Azure.
